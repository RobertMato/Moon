It's 4:00am in October, after a very difficult summer. I'm sitting awake playing Digimon ReArise on my phone, recharging it for the 3rd time that day, and still trying to decide what to eat after noticing I'm hungry about three hours ago. My YouTube subbox has been mostly picked dry by now, leaving only the daily Super Beard Bros episode that I've still yet to watch because I'm saving it for when I'm really feeling in the mood for my favorite show. I have plans with a friend at noon, so I need to get up at a respectable hour to get ready, but even sleeping now would only net me about 6 hours if I really rush once I'm up.

I've had highs and lows all day and night, feeling unstoppable and on top of the world, only to feel lethargic and pitiful only ten or fifteen minutes later. When I'm feeling great I'm planning new things I'm wanting to do. Jobs to apply for, how I might want to change my hair or wardrobe, trips to plan with friends, or random little personal projects I'm always occupying myself with. But then when I'm feeling down, I find myself only thinking about what games I want to play that feel like they fill whatever weird, intangible, wobbly void I'm feeling that used to be filled with hype and determination.

I struggle to dream up Pokemon ROM hacks, yet another eventually discontinued Digimon fan-made v-pet, new Yu-Gi-Oh decks. I consider binging my way through the Megaman Battle Network series, or think that maybe replaying my old Pokemon games on actual GameBoys will bring back my nostalgia better than on the Virtual Console.

### Why though?

Why though? Why do I got to all these old beloved games when life has me down? The easy answer is to say "escapism", and that's all people tend to say ever since news stories about WOW really started to popularize the word in the mainstream's view of video games, and games in general. But one word isn't an answer. One word is far too simple and vague to really be an answer to "Why". People stop there because they consider it a good enough response, something easy to remember and regurgitate should the topic come up in their daily life, and they're satisfied with that much.

But I'm not. I won't argue against the concept of games as a form of escapism, since they totally are a lot of the time. Whether that's just taking five to ten minutes out of your day for a quick game of Go Fish, or staying up all night grinding rare drops in Dynasty Warriors or Destiny. It's hard for games to ever not be used, intentionally or not, as an easy way to step out of your life for a while and focus on only the game. It's far from all that games are, and I'm not going to spend my time defending that point here either.

Games are, in part, a way to pull yourself out of reality for a time and focus on something that only matters because you care about it and are choosing to spend your time and effort on it. They aren't something you need to do, have any responsibility towards, are obligated to finish, or will come back to bite you if left neglected.
